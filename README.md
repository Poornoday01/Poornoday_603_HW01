## Big data and its types with example: 
Big Data is an amount of information that is large in volume and is always expanding exponentially. No typical data management systems can effectively store or process this data because of its magnitude and complexity. Big data is a type of data that is extremely huge. 

Example: 
Social media videos, postings, comments, and photographs all contribute significantly to the creation of social media data. User groups can be created using social big data in order to target people with relevant adverts. Age, gender, interests, and geography are used to rank people. Residents of the same area who frequent the same websites, watch the same videos, and read articles on related subjects are more likely to be drawn to the same goods. 
 
Types of bigdata: 

- Structured data: It is the  data that can be processed, is readily available, and can be kept in an organized format. Because it contains closely synchronized measurements that are determined by defining parameters, structured data in big data is the most straightforward to deal with. 

Ex: 

      - Address 
       - Age 
       - Contact number 
       
- Unstructured data: It is a data whose shape or structures is unknown. Numerous unstructured files including photos, music, logs, and videos make up the data format. Due to its strange structure and unusually large size, this type of data is categorized as complex data. 

Ex: 

Google search 

- Semi-structured data: Unstructured and structured types of data are combined to create semi-structured data. Although this type of data contains unstructured information that does not follow any relational database or formal data model structure, it nonetheless contains the characteristics of structured data. 

Ex: Email

## The 6 v’s of big data: 

- Volume:
 
It is a huge amount of data. The magnitude of the data is a very important factor in determining its value. The term "Big Data" actually refers to data that is quite enormous in volume. This means that the amount of data will determine whether or not a given set of data may be called a big data. 


- Velocity: 

It describes the rapid rate of data accumulation. A significant and constant flow of data is present. The speed at which data is generated and processed to satisfy demands influences the data's potential. 


- Variety:

The terms "structured," "semi-structured," and "unstructured" relate to the types of data.structured data is an organized data and unstructured is an unorganized data and semistructured is an semiorganized data. 


- Veracity: 

It relates to data inconsistencies and uncertainty; that is, readily available data can  occasionally become disorganized, and quality and accuracy are challenging to manage.Because there are so many different data dimensions arising from several  sources, big data is also unpredictable.


- Value: 

The majority of data that has no value is useless to the organization until you can make it valuable, in order to extract information, it must be transformed into something valuable. 


- Variability:

It is different from variety, Data that is gathered and processed within the context of big data  is diverse and inconsistent.

## Phases of bigdata: 

- Data generation: 


The generation of data must take place first in order for the Big Data life cycle to begin. This occurs without conscious thought. Both people and businesses continuously produce data. Every online engagement, every transaction, and every sale create digital records. 

- Data collection and processing: 

Not every piece of data can be used in a later Big Data analysis procedure. Because of this, not all of the data that is produced each day is gathered or utilized.There are many ways in which data can be collected such as forms,surveys ,monitoring and interviews . Once all the data has been gathered, processing is required.First the data is disputed where the data is cleaned and transformed into sets later the data is compressed where data is changed into a format that can be effectively stored. 


- Data storage: 

The process of storing previously gathered and processed data is an essential stage in the Big Data phases. Making databases or data sets is the most popular method for doing this. These are subsequently kept on physical storage servers or cloud servers. Depending on each business or group. It's crucial to set up security procedures and create security copies of all the data that will be stored. 

- Management and analysis: 

This requires Big Data experts to manage, archive, and retrieve data as needed throughout the Big Data life cycle in a particular project.Thus, it is an ongoing process. a procedure that occurs from the start of the project to its conclusion.we use different strategies for analysis such as algorithms,data mining . 

- Visualization and interpretation: 

During this phase, information is graphically represented, typically with the use of one or more visualization tools, Visualization makes it easier to quickly share analysis results with larger audiences. A description or explanation of what the data shows is the  part of the interpretation process.

## Challenges in bigdata analysis: 
 
 - Data storage issues: 

The biggest problem with the massive volumes of data generated every day is storage, especially when the data is in various formats. Traditional databases are unable to store unstructured data. 

- Processing and security: 

The act of reading, converting, extracting, and structuring relevant information from raw data is referred to as processing big data. Organizations are very concerned about security. Information that isn't encrypted is prone to theft or damage from cybercriminals.  Data security experts must therefore strike a compromise between maintaining strict security protocols and providing clients access to data. 

- Lack of understanding of large data: 

Employees might not be familiar with the definition, sources, processing, and storage of data. Data experts may be aware of what's going on, but others may not have a clear picture. 

- Big data tool selection : 

When choosing the simplest instrument for massive Data analysis and storage, companies frequently become confused. Which data storage technology is simpler, HBase or Cassandra? Is Hadoop MapReduce adequate,  Companies struggle to find answers to these issues at times. They discover that they frequently make poor choices and choose for the wrong technologies. 
 
 - Integrating data from different sources: 

In a business, information is gathered from a variety of sources, including social networking pages, ERP software, customer logs, financial reports, emails, PowerPoint presentations, and employee-written reports. It may be difficult to organize reports after combining all of this data.
